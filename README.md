# Interactive-Web-Mapping

This project is an interactive choropleth map built with Mapbox GL JS. It displays the rate of fully vaccinated individuals per 10k people across all counties in Washington state. 

The map is styled using a sequential 5-class blue color scheme, where lighter shades represent a lower vaccination rate and darker shades represent a higher rate.
